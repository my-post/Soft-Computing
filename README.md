Implement fuzzy kNN classification technique. Consider 30% off overall data as training data and 70% as test data. Run the algorithm 20 times with different training and test data. Calculate overall classification accuracy for each run and calculate average classification accuracy.


Implement fuzzy C-means algorithm for Iris (c=3) and Ionosphere (c=2) data. Run this
algorithm 20 times with different randomly chosen seed points. Calculate Jaccard index to measure the
performance of your clustering method.
